# Hi, I'm Aditya 👋 

### 🚀 LLM-based RAG Architect | Multimodal AI Enthusiast

Specializing in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) using tools like LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI and other LLM models. Skilled in working with embeddings and vector databases such as FAISS, Weaviate, Pinecone, and MongoDB. I also focus on multimodal RAG applications with GPT-4 Vision and Google Gemini.
In addition to RAG, I have foundation in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization. Proficient in machine learning algorithms , I am passionate about leveraging AI to drive innovative solutions.

## 🧠 Skills & Expertise

### 🔍 **RAG Systems with LLMs**
I have designed and implemented LLM-enabled Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using various databases, models, and advanced techniques.

#### 🗃 **Databases & Vector Storage**
- **Vector-Based Retrieval**: FAISS, Weaviate, MongoDB, Pinecone, AstraDB
- **Multimodal Vector Storage**: ChromaDB, LanceDB

#### 🤖 **Models**
- **OpenAI GPT**: Including GPT-4 Vision for text and visual tasks
- **Google Gemini**: Including Gemini Pro for advanced multimodal interactions
- **Llama Vision**: Using Llama 3.2 Vision with GROQ for high-performance visual processing

### 📊 **Implemented Multimodal RAG Solutions**
1. **Multimodal Context Storage**: Integrated synchronized audio-visual data processing into RAG pipelines.
2. **PDF Processing with Embedded Images**: Utilized the `unstructured` library for PDF processing, storing content in ChromaDB for effective retrieval.
3. **Image-based Query Processing**: Deployed Gemini Pro/Vision models to handle complex visual queries.
4. **Multi-Document Unified RAG**: Developed solutions to handle diverse document types (PDF, DOC, TXT, PPTX) in a unified RAG framework.

## 🔬 **Advanced RAG Concepts Implemented**

### 🔗 **Hybrid Indexing & Search Techniques**
- **Hybrid Indexing**: Combined MongoDB pipelines with Pinecone for efficient indexing.
- **Hybrid Search**:
  - **ChromaDB**: Sparse (TF-IDF/BM25) + dense vector (FlagEmbedding) search.
  - **Weaviate Hybrid Search**: Merged sparse (BM25) and dense (text2vec-huggingface) retrieval techniques.

### 💡 **Self-Querying RAGs**:
- Designed structured query approaches using query constructors for better query understanding and execution.

### 📝 **Parent Document Retrieval**:
- Applied advanced retrieval techniques based on parent document structure to enhance retrieval precision.

## 📈 **Reranking Techniques Mastered**
- **CohereReranking API** via ContextualCompressionRetriever for improved context-based retrieval.
- **BM25 Algorithm**: Standard for efficient sparse vector retrieval.
- **Cross-Encoder Methods**: For highly accurate reranking of results.
- **FlashRank & Flash Reranker**: Implemented FlashRank for superfast reranking, based on work by Prithiviraj Damodaran.

### ⚖️ **Addressing the "Lost in the Middle" Phenomenon**
- **Document Filtering & Reordering**: Through ContextualCompressionRetriever and RAG Fusion with reciprocal reranking.
- **Flash Reranker**: Optimized for efficient reranking in large document sets.
